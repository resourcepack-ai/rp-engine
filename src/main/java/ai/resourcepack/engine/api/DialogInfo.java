/**
 * A dialog — the data-driven screen a server opens on a client, added in
 * Minecraft 1.21.6.
 *
 * <p><strong>The engine does not model what is on it.</strong> A dialog is
 * defined by a JSON object whose schema is the game's, moves with the game, and
 * is read by the client rather than by us — so this carries that object as
 * TEXT and hands it to the game unread. Everything the engine does with a
 * dialog it can do without knowing whether the thing has three buttons or a
 * slider on it: write the file, and name it in a command.
 *
 * <p>That is deliberate rather than lazy. The alternative is a second
 * implementation of Minecraft's dialog codec living here, drifting from the
 * real one release by release, and turning every new field into a plugin
 * update before anybody can use it. What the engine adds is the part the game
 * does not: a NAME. A dialog in a datapack is addressed by a namespaced id
 * somebody has to type; one registered here is {@code mypack:shop}, listed by
 * {@code /rp dialogs} and openable from the API like any other content.
 *
 * <p>Two things about a dialog are worth knowing from outside this class.
 * A dialog is <em>registry</em> data, so it reaches a client through a
 * datapack rather than a resource pack — see the dialog datapack writer for
 * what that costs. And a pack drawn in Studio puts its picture in the dialog's
 * body as a font glyph, which means the art is in the resource pack and the
 * dialog is not: a player who has one without the other sees a screen with the
 * right buttons and no picture, or a picture with nothing to draw it in.
