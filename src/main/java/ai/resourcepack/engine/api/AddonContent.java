/**
 * Installs the content folder a plugin carries in its own jar into the
 * engine's {@code content/} directory.
 *
 * <p><strong>Every addon needs this and none of it is about what the addon
 * IS.</strong> A plugin built on the engine ships its models, items, vehicles
 * and emotes as an ordinary content folder inside its jar
 * ({@code resources/content/<namespace>/}), and on enable it has to end up in
 * {@code plugins/RPEngine/content/<namespace>/} where the engine reads it.
 * The first addon wrote seventy lines to do that; the second would have
 * copied them, and the third would have copied the copy, bugs included.
 *
 * <pre>
 * if (AddonContent.install(this, engine, "skateboards")) {
 *     engine.reload();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>A version stamp decides whether to look.</strong> A
 * {@code .version} file beside the content says which build of the plugin last
 * wrote it, so restarting on the same jar copies nothing and reloads nothing -
 * a reload rebuilds every pack on the server, and doing that on every boot for
 * files that have not changed is a cost with no reason.
 *
 * <p><strong>The folder is the server owner's to change, and an update keeps
 * their changes.</strong> A new build writes only the files it ships, so a file
 * the owner added (a second skin, a different sound) is never touched. And a
 * file the addon shipped that the owner has since EDITED is kept too: an
 * {@code .installed} file beside the content records a hash of every file as it
 * was installed, and a file whose contents no longer match its hash has been
 * changed by somebody, so the new version is not written over it. The console
 * names every file kept that way. Files the owner has not touched are updated,
 * files new in this build are added, and files the last build installed that
 * this one no longer ships are removed (unless changed, when they stay the
 * owner's).
 *
 * <p>To take the new version of a file that was kept, delete it and restart
 * (or reload the addon): a missing file is always installed. A folder written
 * before {@code .installed} existed has no hashes, so its first update installs
 * every shipped file over what is there, exactly as installs always did, and
 * then writes the record: the protection starts from the update after. An edit
 * made before then is overwritten once, as it always was, because an edit and
 * an old version look alike and freezing every old file would stop the addon
 * updating at all.
 *
 * <p><strong>Whole files or none.</strong> Each is written to a temporary
 * name and moved into place, so a server that dies mid-install has either the
 * old file or the new one, never half of one for the engine to choke on.
