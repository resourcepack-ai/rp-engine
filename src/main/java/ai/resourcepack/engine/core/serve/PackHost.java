/**
 * Gets built packs to players: decides the link each player is sent, and
 * serves the pack behind it when this server is the one serving it.
 *
 * <p>There are four ways, {@link Mode}, chosen by {@code host.mode}. The
 * default uploads each pack to ResourcePack AI's pack host, because the two
 * that serve from this machine each need something a new server often lacks
 * (an open second port, or no proxy in front), and the only symptom of either
 * going wrong is "failed to download" on the player's screen. A pack whose
 * upload fails is served from the game port instead, if it can be.
 *
 * <p>What follows is about the own-port server, the one with the most to say.
 *
 * <p>Built in rather than left to the server owner, because a plugin that
 * builds a pack and then tells somebody to go and find hosting for it has not
 * finished the job. An owner who already has hosting can ignore this and
 * publish the zips themselves; the URL is the only thing the rest of the engine
 * needs.
 *
 * <p>A deliberately tiny HTTP/1.1 server: GET and HEAD of a handful of static
 * files, one request per connection. It used to be the JDK's own
 * {@code HttpServer} on a pool of four threads, and that server reads a
 * request's headers on the worker thread with no time limit, so four clients
 * that sent one byte and then nothing took the pack host away from everybody
 * else. Its only timeouts are JVM-wide system properties, which would also
 * have changed every other plugin's server in the same process. So the
 * connection handling is this class's own, and it is bounded at every step:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a client has {@link Limits#headerMillis} to send its request once a
 *       worker picks it up;</li>
 *   <li>a response that makes no progress for {@link Limits#stallMillis} is
 *       cut off, and none may run longer than {@link Limits#responseMillis};</li>
 *   <li>one address may hold at most {@link Limits#perAddress} connections at
 *       once, waiting or being served. Loopback and private addresses are not
 *       counted, because a reverse proxy in front of the host makes every
 *       player arrive from one of those;</li>
 *   <li>the pool and the queue in front of it are both bounded, and a
 *       connection beyond them is answered 503 rather than held.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>The hash is in the URL.</strong> A client caches by hash, and
 * some caches and proxies cache by URL, so a rebuilt bundle gets a new path
 * and cannot be served a stale body by anything in between.
