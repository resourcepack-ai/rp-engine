/**
 * Sitting on a placed model.
 *
 * <p>A seat is an invisible marker armour stand with the player riding it.
 * That is the only way to sit somebody in vanilla: the player has to be a
 * passenger of something, and an armour stand is the smallest something there
 * is. A marker one has no hitbox, takes no damage and is not saved to the
 * chunk, so an unclean shutdown cannot leave a field of invisible stands
 * behind — the thing that goes wrong with every implementation of this.
 *
 * <p>The stand is removed when the player gets off, when they log out, and when
 * the model is broken. All three, because a seat that outlives its chair is an
 * invisible thing a player can stand on for ever.
