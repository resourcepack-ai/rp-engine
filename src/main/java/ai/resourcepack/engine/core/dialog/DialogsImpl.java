/**
 * Opening dialogs. The implementation behind {@link Dialogs}.
 *
 * <p>Two things happen here and they are a long way apart in time. The
 * catalogue is replaced whenever content loads, and the datapack is rewritten
 * with it ({@link DialogDatapack}); showing one is a command dispatched from
 * the console, later.
 *
 * <p><b>A command rather than an API call</b> — {@code /dialog show} — because
 * Bukkit has no dialog API at all and Paper's is Paper's. The engine compiles
 * against Spigot and runs on both, and a vanilla command that has existed
 * since the feature did works the same on every server that has the feature.
 * The cost is that opening one is a console dispatch; the benefit is that
 * nothing here has to be written twice.
 *
 * <p><b>The dialog travels IN the command, which is why none of this needs a
 * restart.</b> {@code /dialog show} takes either a registry id or a whole
 * dialog written out in SNBT, and it has taken both since the first snapshot
 * that had dialogs at all — the same version this engine requires for them. So
 * the ordinary route hands the game the dialog itself ({@link DialogSnbt}) and
 * the registry is not consulted: a dialog that arrived in a push thirty
 * seconds ago opens now, and one edited in Studio opens as edited rather than
 * as the copy some earlier start happened to read.
 *
 * <p>Naming the id is still the fallback, for the narrow case of a dialog SNBT
 * cannot carry — a control character inside a string is the realistic one. That
 * route does need the restart, and is the only thing left that does.
